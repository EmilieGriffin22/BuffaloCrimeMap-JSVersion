This web application uses data provided by the Buffalo Police Department via OpenData Buffalo (https://data.buffalony.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents/d6g9-xbgu/about_data) to map occurences of crime under the jurisdiction of the Buffalo Police. These crimes are organized by type, and the map shows occurences of crime beginning two weeks prior to loading time. 

To graph this data the Plotly JavaScript Open Source Graphing Library is used.
